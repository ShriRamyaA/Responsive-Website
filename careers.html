        <h2>Why should you join us?</h2>
        <p>We are not a traditional training institute where trainers
            come, present some presentation and participants just chill, go back and end up not making 
            most of it. Here we believe it is only through self learning can a person gain maximum 
            knowledge. That doesn't mean if you join as an employee in StackRoute you will not have any 
            work. If you choose StackRoute as your career option, then you must be ready to mentor the participants 
            with utmost dedication. There is no boundary for what we teach. This is no 9-6 desk-job. So, as
            an employee you will be the guide in the entire journey of 
            the participants in stackroute. If you beleive even sky is not a limt
            then please join us by applying at <a href="#">www.stackroute.career.in</a> and feed the inner teacher in you.
